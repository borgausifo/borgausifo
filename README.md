# Hi I'm Borga 👋

Before you swipe down any further, let me draw your attention to reasons why you might want

to know me 

•	I have a remarkable aptitude for finding new technology trends to implement in processes 

•	I am a firm believer in the data analytic approach for solving challenges in engineering and other business areas.

Outside of work, I keep learning and incorporate my new skills to my personal projects, especially in scalable web applications and DevOps areas; and I'm an avid fitness fanatic, cyclist, and history addict.

I also consider myself a not just a “tech enthusiast“ but also a “petrol head” and can sometimes be spotted in a near dealer parking lot next to coupes :).

If you are curious about either, I need sponsorship or not. The answer is I DO NOT need sponsorship.
