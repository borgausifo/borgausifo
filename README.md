# 𝙷𝚒 𝙸'𝚖 𝙱𝚘𝚛𝚐𝚊  👋

Before you swipe down any further, let me draw your attention to reasons why you might wantto know me 

-	I have a **remarkable** aptitude for learning new technology trends to implement in processes 

-	I am a **firm believer** in the data analytic approach for solving challenges in engineering and other business areas.

Outside of work, I keep learning and incorporate my new skills to my personal projects, especially in scalable web applications and DevOps areas; and I'm an avid fitness fanatic, cyclist, and history addict.

I also consider myself a not just a “tech enthusiast“ but also a “petrol head” and can sometimes be spotted in a near dealer parking lot next to coupes :).
